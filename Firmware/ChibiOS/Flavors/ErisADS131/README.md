Eris is an arduino firmware that facilitates the implementation 
of data aquisition, machine learning and control code in arduino.

// ErisEMG is the Eris flavor for reading EMG from stretchmed sensors

// Any modifications that are not customization of the main modules must be 
// inserted into barebones Eris.


// IT USES ANALOG FOR NOW BUT IT WILL BE MODIFIED FOR USING THE SPI DATA
// Preserves sinewave module for demonstration and debugging purposes.


Dependencies:

Code is based on ChibiOS (ChRt) to handle tasks
// lib folder contains all the required libraries
