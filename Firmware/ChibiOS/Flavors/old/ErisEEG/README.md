Eris is an arduino firmware that facilitates the implementation 
of data aquisition, machine learning and control code in arduino.

// ErisEEG is the Eris flavor for reading ADS1299 as a EEG frontend

// Any modifications that are not customization of the main modules must be 
// inserted into barebones Eris.

Dependencies:

// Code is based on ChibiOS (ChRt) to handle tasks
// lib folder contains all the required libraries
